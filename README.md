# Cookie Cutter Web
## Getting Started

```bash
$ make server.install      # Install the pip dependencies on the docker container
$ make server.start        # Run the container containing your local python server
```

## Development

To develop locally, here are your two options:

```bash
$ make server.start           # Create the containers containing your python server in your terminal
$ make server.daemon          # Create the containers containing your python server as a daemon
```

The containers will reload by themselves as your source code is changed.
You can check the logs in the `./server.log` file.

## Testing

To add a unit test, simply create a `test_*.py` file anywhere in `./test/`, prefix your test classes with `Test` and your testing methods with `test_`. Unittest will run them automaticaly.
You can add objects in your database that will only be used in your tests, see example.
You can run your tests in their own container with the command:

```bash
$ make test
```
